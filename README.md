## Introduction
- **Overview of the Microservices Project**:  
  This project is designed to manage the booking and listing of tickets, providing a comprehensive system for users to book tickets and view their bookings. The application also integrates a payment gateway for secure transactions.

- **Key Technologies Used**:  
  The project leverages a variety of modern technologies to ensure robustness, scalability, and efficiency:
  - **Docker**: For containerizing services, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
  - **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, improving code quality and maintainability.
  - **Node.js & Express**: Used for building the backend services, ensuring high performance and flexibility.
  - **Kubernetes**: Manages containerized applications in a clustered environment, enabling automated deployment, scaling, and management.
  - **Bull MQ**: Implements job queues and handles background tasks efficiently.
  - **Redis**: Used as a fast, in-memory data structure store for caching and job queue management.
  - **Ingress-Nginx**: Facilitates load balancing and routing traffic to the appropriate services within the Kubernetes cluster.
  - **Stripe**: Integrated for handling payment processing securely and efficiently.
